# REM Waste Management React Challenge

This repository contains my solution to the REM Waste Management React assessment, focusing on a complete redesign of the "Select Skip" page. My approach began with a detailed analysis of the provided instructions and the job listing to ensure alignment with core requirements. The primary goal was to create a visually distinct and accessible web page.

## Technology Stack

The following technologies were chosen to build a modern, efficient, and maintainable application:

- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Design & Prototyping:** Figma

## Design Process

### Phase 1: Discovery & Research

My initial phase involved a deep dive into the existing REM Waste website and a broader exploration of similar industry platforms. This research helped me understand the current user flow, extract key brand elements (logo, color scheme), and inform typography choices for readability and theme fit.

### Phase 2: Visual Design & Prototyping

On the basis of these insights, I developed the visual design in Figma, creating mockups for both mobile and desktop. This ensured a fully responsive and intuitive user experience, delivering a clean, modern interface that departs from the original page while preserving core functionality.
